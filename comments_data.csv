"I think the importance of sleep is very overlooked. I totally believe that sleep functions as a kind of self reparation self healing cycle for the human body. In the sense that any health issue you have will be helped greatly if you just allow your body to completely slow down and go to sleep.

Good deep sleep clears the mind, recharges the body, it is simply good for health.",713,12

"I’ve been an insomniac since college. Talked to many doctors (all I’ve spoken with have a very limited understanding of the problem).  What he describes makes perfect sense. I feel like I have zero short term memory, I lose thing all the time, my thinking slows, takes me longer to come up with words/vocabulary, slows my writing and thinking. It’s horrendous. I get anxiety just thinking about going to bed. Hope more can be done in this area. I find if I just get into a rhythm, sometime I stay there. Usually takes meds to get me there but then I try to get myself off them and get natural sleep. Nothing is better than a full night of natural sleep. Nothing.",219,11

My professional life was deeply affected by this, and I still struggle with my anxiety now. Currently, dealing with a restless partner during the night, I gained back to the old results of sleeping deprivation, and I say: it is torture.

"I have found breathing exercises very useful in getting myself to sleep whenever I don't feel sleepy at bedtime.  Or doing a countdown from 100 or from 200 to zero depending on how sleepless I am.

"His book on sleep is incredibly insightful. Certainly one of the most impactful I have ever read. I have benefitted from many of the tips on sleeping better. However, whilst I feel that the general advice of when to sleep and wake up is a good one, it certainly does not fit everyone, also does not the same person at all times of the year. Sleeping at 10 pm and waking up at 6:00 am could mean different things to each person depending on his place in the world, and even to the same person depending on the season. It could be great advice in June, but not the best in December. It could be great for someone in Spain in the summer, but not the best for a Canadian in December.

I strongly believe that the optimal indicator of sleeping and waking up is the Sun’s position. This has always been the case for our ancestors before watches and artificial light, and there is consensus on it’s impact on our hormonal levels throughout the day relative to its angle. So maybe the best advice is to get a solar calendar app and use it as an indicator for the best sleep and wake up times, and shift the sleeping window relative the the sunrise and sunset times.",17,2

Besides the most obvious things, like night shifts, which should be totally eliminated and daylight savings nonsense there is one more problem related to teenagers, whose circadian rhythm shifts later than 11 p.m. in most cases.

Also, and this cannot be overstated: Some people are naturally nocturnal. If you're a day person just imagine what it's like if life forces you to be awake at night and then you have to try to catch up on sleep during the day. That's what night people feel when the shoe's on the other foot.",1,1

"I’ve always known that getting “x” amount of hours of sleep can impact your daily activity and other all health, but I will admit to being ignorant to just how big of an impact it will have. My sleep habits seem to changed often as sometimes I can get minimal sleep and function as normally as I would, and then I can get a full night of sleep and sometimes am able to function better and other times I feel that I’m just the same as with minimal sleep. I don’t know what that means for me, but it is something I’ve never really paid attention to before now. I wonder what kind of results I would have if I were to participate in such a sleep study; perhaps that is something I can look into for the future.",0,0

"Summary: Get a deep sleep for 8hrs every day
Men who slept only 4-5 hrs had significantly smaller testicles and their testosterone levels were 10 years their age

Sleep is the save button for learning
 and is also needed before learning

In a study difference in learning between a group having slept for 8hrs and a group having pulled an all-nighter is 40%

Hippocampus(informational inbox in brain) activity was much more in sleep rich and none in sleep-deprived

Brain spindles in deep sleep makes file-transfer
s which helps in retaining information.
Sleep and cardiovascular activity are related- more heart attacks when daylight savings
 are on due to lesser sleep.
Sleep and immune system- a huge 70% drop in immune killer cells when one gets a 4-hr sleep.

The shorter your sleep shorter your life
.
There is a damaging impact of alcohol and caffeine
 on sleep
Tips for better sleep:

	1) Regularity in sleep
 - Sleep and wake up at the same time every day 
	2) Keep it cool- Keep the room cool for better sleep- optimal temperature is18degC

If you toss and turn in bed- then go to a different room and do a different activity and come back when you feel sleepy- this will make associations in the brain between being sleepy and the bedroom",2059,47

"I’m 56 years old, and I haven’t been able to sleep for more than about 2 hours at a time about twice a day, very little of which is restful sleep according to my Apple Watch. This has been the case for a few decades now. However, my heart rate drops to as low as 47 bpm and has a very large heart rate dip and a high hear-rate variability, putting me into the 98th percentile for each of these measurements. Maybe that’s my adaptation to lack of sleep throughout the past few decades. I know that obesity and senility are linked to lack of sleep, so that’s a great concern; however, I’m really unable to sleep and definitely can’t get into a deep sleep for more than a few minutes at a time. I’m annoyed when people like my wife claim they didn’t sleep at all when in fact they’ve been snoring for six hours, indicating they have been sleeping. It seems that people think they haven’t slept if they’ve lost only 2 hours of sleep. I’m the opposite in the sense that I’m physically unable to sleep for more than 2 hours and have to try about 4 hours later to try to get an additional 2 hours of sleep, usually while there’s a lot of noise in the house or apartment.",1,0

"Summary of the above session 

*Research and Experiments :*

- Testosterone levels are greater, a decade of difference.
- Sleep before learning (40% more efficient after sleep).
- Better sleep, better learning (Hippocampus).
- Big powerful brain waves act as file transfer making temporary to permanent memory during deep sleep.
- Worse sleep, worse memory and more ageing and Alzheimer.
- Small voltage inserted in young healthy brain, amplifies brain waves.
- 24 % increase in heart attacks, car accidents and suicides during springs.
- Natural killer cells activity decreases by 70 % as 4 hours sleep leads to cancer of prostate.
- Sleep and gene (6 hrs vs 8 hrs sleep) genes are distorted due to lack of sleep .

*Tips for better sleep :*

- Regularity : go to bed at same time weather its weekend.
- Optimum temperature of room while sleep.
- Tossing and turning in bed? get out of bed go to other room
- Go to bed only when you feel sleepy don’t wait for sleep on bed, you don’t sit on dinning table hoping to get hungry.

Hope you find this helpful :)",1,0

"Tradução Para português 

Muito obrigado. Bem, eu gostaria de começar com os testículos. Homens que dormem cinco horas por noite têm testículos significativamente menores do que aqueles que dormem sete horas ou mais. Além disso, homens que rotineiramente dormem apenas de 4 a 5 horas por noite terão um nível de testosterona equivalente ao de alguém 10 anos mais velho. Portanto, a falta de sono envelhece um homem em uma década em termos desse aspecto crítico da saúde. E observamos uma diminuição equivalente na saúde reprodutiva feminina causada pela falta de sono. Essa é a melhor notícia que tenho para você hoje. A partir desse ponto, as coisas podem piorar. Não apenas vou lhe falar sobre as coisas maravilhosamente boas que acontecem quando você dorme, mas também sobre as coisas alarmantemente ruins que acontecem quando você não dorme o suficiente, tanto para o seu cérebro quanto para o seu corpo. Vou começar pelo cérebro e pelas funções de aprendizagem e memória. Porque o que descobrimos nos últimos 10 anos, mais ou menos, é que você precisa dormir após aprender para essencialmente pressionar o botão de salvar nessas novas memórias para que você não as esqueça. Mas recentemente, descobrimos que você também precisa dormir antes de aprender.

E agora, para preparar seu cérebro, quase como uma esponja seca pronta para absorver inicialmente novas informações. E sem sono, os circuitos de memória do cérebro essencialmente ficam encharcados, por assim dizer, e você não consegue absorver novas memórias. Deixe-me mostrar os dados. Neste estudo, decidimos testar a hipótese de que passar a noite em claro era uma boa ideia. Então, pegamos um grupo de indivíduos e os dividimos em dois grupos experimentais, um grupo que dormiria e um grupo que ficaria privado de sono. O grupo que dormiria teria oito horas completas de sono. Já o grupo privado de sono, nós manteríamos acordados no laboratório sob supervisão total. Nada de cochilos ou cafeína, aliás, então é horrível para todos os envolvidos. E no dia seguinte, colocaríamos esses participantes dentro de um scanner de ressonância magnética (MRI) e faríamos eles tentarem aprender uma lista completa de novos fatos enquanto capturamos instantâneos da atividade cerebral. E depois testaríamos para ver quão efetiva foi essa aprendizagem. E é isso que você está vendo aqui no eixo vertical. E quando comparamos os dois grupos, encontramos um déficit significativo de 40% na capacidade do cérebro de criar novas memórias sem sono.

Acho que isso deve ser preocupante considerando o que sabemos sobre o sono nas populações educacionais atualmente. Na verdade, para contextualizar, seria a diferença entre uma criança se sair muito bem em um exame ou fracassar miseravelmente, 40%. E descobrimos o que acontece de errado em seu cérebro para causar esses tipos de deficiências de aprendiz

agem. E há uma estrutura que fica no lado esquerdo e direito do seu cérebro chamada hipocampo. E você pode pensar no hipocampo como a caixa de entrada de informações do seu cérebro. Ele é muito bom em receber novos arquivos de memória e depois retê-los. E quando olhamos para essa estrutura nas pessoas que tiveram uma noite completa de sono, vimos muita atividade saudável relacionada à aprendizagem. Porém, nas pessoas privadas de sono, na verdade não conseguimos encontrar nenhum sinal significativo. É como se a privação de sono tivesse fechado sua caixa de entrada de memória e qualquer novo arquivo que chegasse fosse rejeitado. Você não consegue efetivamente fixar novas experiências na memória. Então, isso é o que pode acontecer de ruim se eu tirar o sono de você. Mas vamos voltar ao grupo de controle por um momento.

Você se lembra daqueles indivíduos que dormiram oito horas completas? Bem, podemos fazer uma pergunta bem diferente. O que há na qualidade fisiológica do seu sono, quando você realmente dorme, que restaura e melhora sua memória e capacidade de aprendizagem todos os dias? E ao colocar eletrodos em toda a cabeça, descobrimos que existem ondas cerebrais grandes e poderosas que ocorrem durante as fases mais profundas do sono, e essas ondas têm sobre elas explosões espetaculares de atividade elétrica que chamamos de fusos de sono. E é a qualidade combinada dessas ondas cerebrais do sono profundo que age como um mecanismo de transferência de arquivos durante a noite, transferindo memórias de um reservatório vulnerável de curto prazo para um local de armazenamento permanente e de longo prazo dentro do cérebro, protegendo-as e tornando-as seguras. E é importante entender o que durante o sono realmente proporciona esses benefícios à memória, pois há implicações médicas e sociais reais. E deixe-me falar sobre uma área em que levamos esse trabalho para a prática clínica, que é o contexto do envelhecimento e da demência. Porque não é segredo que, à medida que envelhecemos, nossas habilidades de aprendizagem e memória começam a diminuir e declinar.

Mas o que também descobrimos é que uma assinatura fisiológica do envelhecimento é que seu sono piora, especialmente a qualidade do sono profundo que acabei de mencionar. E apenas no ano passado, finalmente publicamos evidências de que essas duas coisas não estão simplesmente ocorrendo ao mesmo tempo. Elas estão significativamente inter-relacionadas. E isso sugere que a interrupção do sono profundo é um fator subestimado que contribui para o declínio cognitivo ou declínio da memória no envelhecimento, e mais recentemente descobrimos também na doença de Alzheimer. Agora, eu sei que essa é uma notícia incrivelmente deprimente. Ela está a caminho, está chegando até você. Mas há uma possível luz no fim do túnel aqui. Ao contrário de muitos outros fatores associados ao envelhecimento, como mudanças na estrutura

física do cérebro, que são extremamente difíceis de tratar, o sono é uma peça que falta no quebra-cabeça explicativo do envelhecimento e da doença de Alzheimer, o que é empolgante porque talvez possamos fazer algo a respeito. E uma maneira pela qual estamos abordando isso em meu centro de sono não é usando pílulas para dormir, a propósito. Infelizmente, elas são ferramentas grosseiras que não produzem um sono natural. Em vez disso, estamos desenvolvendo um método baseado nisso.

É chamado de estimulação cerebral de corrente contínua direta. Você insere uma pequena quantidade de voltagem no cérebro, tão pequena que geralmente você não a sente, mas ela tem um impacto mensurável. Agora, se você aplicar essa estimulação durante o sono em adultos jovens e saudáveis, como se estivesse cantando no ritmo dessas ondas cerebrais do sono profundo, não apenas pode ampliar o tamanho dessas ondas cerebrais do sono profundo, como também podemos quase dobrar a quantidade de benefício à memória que você obtém do sono. A questão agora é se podemos traduzir essa mesma peça de tecnologia acessível e potencialmente portátil para adultos mais velhos e pessoas com demência. Podemos restaurar uma qualidade saudável do sono profundo? E ao fazer isso, podemos preservar aspectos da função de aprendizagem e memória delas? Essa é minha verdadeira esperança agora. É um de nossos objetivos ambiciosos, por assim dizer. Então, esse é um exemplo de sono para o seu cérebro, mas o sono também é essencial para o seu corpo. Já falamos sobre a perda de sono e o sistema reprodutivo. Ou eu poderia falar sobre a perda de sono e o sistema cardiovascular, e tudo o que é necessário é uma hora. Porque há um experimento global realizado com 1,6 bilhão de pessoas em 70 países, duas vezes por ano.

É chamado de Horário de Verão. Na primavera, quando perdemos uma hora de sono, vemos um aumento subsequente de 24% nos ataques cardíacos no dia seguinte. No outono, quando ganhamos uma hora de sono, vemos uma redução de 21% nos ataques cardíacos. Incrível, não é? E vemos exatamente o mesmo perfil para acidentes de carro, acidentes de trânsito, até mesmo taxas de suicídio. Mas para uma análise mais profunda, quero focar nisso, a perda de sono e seu sistema imunológico. E aqui vou apresentar esses elementos azuis encantadores na imagem.",0,0

"Psychology major here. I say this so more can perhaps become attentive to what i'm about to say, and decide to read this entire post, and not for any other purpose than this. 


Some more tips on how to get a better quality of sleep, I will also include some of the remarks made by Matt Walker.


(1) Exercise regularly, 4-5 times/week for about 30 minutes. It doesn't have to be very intense, a brisk walk will do you wonders.


(2) Maintain a healthy diet, by this I mean, exclude any processed foods, such as white rice, white pasta, maximize your intake of antioxidants, i.e. fruits and vegetables mostly. Instead of eating white rice, or white pasta, try to buy them in their ""fuller"" versions, i.e. brown pasta and rice. They will give you more fiber, vitamins and minerals. Nowadays we fill our bellies with foods high in calories, but incredibly low in vitamins, minerals and fiber.
Cut down on saturated fats, i.e. fats found primarily in processed meats, like chicken and meat, but also in ice cream, candy, cookies, doughnuts and muffins. Chicken and meat is a good nutritional source in itself, but you should be wary of how the meat has been treated in the factories before consumption.


(3) Try to eliminate any drug, alcohol or tobacco usage , not only will this make you sleep, and sleep better, but you will have a better quality of sleep, and it will do wonders to your health in general.


(4) Try to eliminate any added sugar from your diet. Here are some of the effects of sugar consumption; information taken from a book by Susanna Ehdin, PhD in immunology.
Sugar can cause;
(i) Too low or high blood sugar levels.
(ii) Sugar affects the structure of our proteins, hence (amongst other things), our ability to transport nutrients through our body becomes impaired.
(iii) Sugar raises the level of bloodfats and cholesterol in your blood.
(iv) Sugar can cause hyperactivity, inability to concentrate, excessive worrying, and irritable mood in children. 
(v) Sugar can cause depression.
(vi) Sugar can cause fungal infections.
(vii) Sugar can contribute to brittle-bone disease.
(viii) Sugar can cause fatty plaques in your arteries, as well as cardiovascular diseases. 
(ix) Sugar can cause migraines and headaches.
(x) Humans who consume excessive amounts of sugar has a three times higher risk of developing Parkinsons disease. 
(xi) The mothers sugar consumption during pregnancy can have effects on the development of her baby. 
(xii) Sugar has a correlation with the development of degenerative diseases, (diabetes, dementia, and kidney failure).
(xiii) Sugar impairs your immune system.  


(5) Make sure you have good sleep hygiene, i.e. your bed should only be for sleeping, not anything else, so you can, as Walker pointed out here, make your brain have a more robust association with your bed and sleep. Maintain a night routine, this has been found to make your brain become ""prepared"" for sleep, i.e. dim the lights an hour before bed, avoid any bright lights, rigorous physical activity, and make sure you cool the temperature in your room. This will have a positive effect on your predisposition to sleep because your brain will start secreting hormones that are conducive to sleep. 
Disruption, i.e. having bright lights, a warm room, and staring aimlessly at a bright computer or phone screen, will impair your brains secretion of sleep hormones, and it will stimulate the secretion of cortisol, a hormone that makes you more alert. This is not conducive to sleep. 


(6) Make sure you drink 1-1.5 liter of water/day, your sleep quality will improve. 


(7) As Walker mentioned, maintain a sleep schedule, where you wake up, and sleep roughly during the same hours, everyday. 


(8) Make sure to PRIORITIZE your sleep, so if you have any work, don't postpone it until later, try to do everything before the hour of sleep is forthcoming. 


(9) Try to tidy up your room and make your bed, make sure you get FRESH air while sleeping, at least try to, so your body can get rid of its toxins more effectively, contrary to popular belief, we get rid of almost all of our toxins from breathing, so make sure to provide your body with fresh air, rich in oxygen for this process to work better. I know, that some of us do not have this luxury, and it pains me that it has to be like this. But hopefully, if you can open a window, or something else to let authentic air flow into your room, you should do this. 


And lastly, remember, as Walker remarked. Sleep is crucial for EVERY aspect of your life. No part of your body can escape the debilitating effects of sleep deprivation, trust me on this one. 


I really hope this helps you if you have reached the end of my post. Thank you for having read it, and if you can, please, spread the word so you can also contribute to a better quality of life amongst your loved ones.


Thank you.",468,44

- Less sleep lowers testosterone levels in men
- Less sleep affects your brain's learning ability and its receptiveness toward learning new things
- Less sleep worsens your memory
- Less sleep adversely affects your cardiological health - Increased risks of heart attacks
- Less sleep has a correlation with higher suicide rates
- Less sleep results in fewer natural killer cells (cells that eliminate diseases and illnesses), leaving you more vulnerable to illnesses and a weaker immune system
- Less sleep might result in a higher risk of cancer (shift work is said to be a ""probable"" carcinogen going to show the extent to which sleep deprivation is harmful)
- Less sleep results in more harmful genes which cause cardiovascular attacks, tumor promotion as well as long-term chronic inflammation while at the same time lower the number of genes that promote immune functions.
